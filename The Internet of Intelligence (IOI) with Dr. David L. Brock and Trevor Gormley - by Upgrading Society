The Internet of Intelligence (IOI) with Dr. David L. Brock and Trevor Gormley - by Upgrading Society

Unknown Speaker  0:04  
Welcome to Upgrading Society, a podcast community centered around discussing dissecting and implementing projects that are seeking to improve the world. Our goal for each episode is to leave you the listener with a good sense of what each project is all about. To do this, we have developed what we call a cap score.

Unknown Speaker  0:19  
CJ take it away.

CJ  0:21  
C is for clarity, A for action, and P for potential. Clarity is how clear your ideas. Action is what you have done thus far. And Potential is how promising your vision is. Each letter will be scored from one to nine, leaving us with a three digit score at the end. To get these ideas to the highest score possible. We have three tools to help facilitate the conversation.

Unknown Speaker  0:45  
Mike, tell us more.

Mike  0:47  
When you hear this sound, the person speaking has to explain what they mean in simpler terms. We call this no big words. When you hear this sound everyone takes a deep breath and explains how they Feeling in the moment and give a score of one to 10 or comprehension. We call this checking in. When you hear this sound. People riff on future scenarios based on what they just heard. We call this what it. That's it well enough. So let's go. So David, we've been talking about something that you refer to as the Internet of intelligence, you explain a little bit more what you mean about that? Yeah, sure. You know, it's kind of exciting for us. And it's an exciting time because, you know, if you think about the history of the internet, it was basically the idea of connecting computers together computers and devices on and it was a fairly low level connection. And as they as it kind of moved up and improved, we had the web, then on the web essentially allows you to display make use of syntax means you can, you know, display in different places you can mark a picture But the computers themselves had no idea what was being communicated. They just know how to present it. And furthermore, there was no meaning behind the language other than, again, presentation. So imagine if you will had a network based on the same foundation. But now there's meaning behind the communication. So the computers, data systems actually are cognizant of what's being seen. Now, this will enable the networking of artificial intelligences, like we've networked computers. And so that is division. Again, internet of intelligence.

Unknown Speaker  2:41  
Checking Yeah, I thought it was gonna be too fast or too soon, but I want to,

Unknown Speaker  2:44  
I feel like that was a lot of information. A lot of big concept things here. I want to see a real quick check in of how we feel about this. So I've heard this before. And so I'm pretty on board with what you do. Talking about. Mike, how do you feel? Yeah, I mean, we've talked a little bit about this, and I'm at like, five or six. So I understand. I think I think my thing is, where is AI right now in your guys's minds, compared to where what you're talking about is going like, what's the dissonance right now, if you could like, explain that. So I don't know how to score this, but when you say that it went during that initial speech, I went from very excited to a little bit scared immediately. So I'm really excited to see like, you know, what we're getting into here, but either way, it's sparking an emotion. So maybe, maybe six because I think I get it, but it's maybe I don't know what direction it goes in and around this. This is good. Phenomenal. And then did you want it one more time for you? What was your question? My question is really like, again, what do you say very Excited, not knowing where it's going, but like, where are we right now? So I can kind of grasp in the spectrum where AI is now versus what you guys are talking about. For the future and for what liquid is in comparison, like how close Yeah, like this, just like, the Yeah, how close how close and like, Where? Obviously, it's like, we're seeing what, you know, you're talking about the internet and connecting two computers together and like that changed everything, right? Where is AI? Is AI, just the computer at this point? And what that is, is far more than that, right? Yeah. So let me kind of just, you know, tease through these one at a time. So, you know, into your analogy, where is intelligence now on, you know, this, this analogy isn't perfect, but it's as, you know, computers for them. So they're powerful machines be able to do a lot of things. But you couldn't share information between them without having a common network and a protocol and mechanism for them to communicate with each other. And so that you created this ability to have the internet and these, these connected or network systems. But, you know, artificial intelligence, by and large are, are similar programs, systems that you interact with. And it comes through ability to mimic some of the capabilities in person, but they tend to be general. And they don't tend to or I don't believe there's any capability right now. And that's the weekend for having these API's to talk to each other. So in other words, just as the company and just as you guys have different skills, and you work together in within the company, there's many people with different skills, they work together and you communicate and talk to each other using emails, your document these are things that you can understand there is no such thing Artificial Intelligence. So there is no common language for the guys to talk to each other. They can't understand the document you're looking at. They can send data back and forth between them because it deals with that. And so people are left with creating these sort of monolithic artificial intelligences as opposed to having networks are communities they eyes that can solve problems by sharing capabilities. So you certainly see a lot of individual they eyes, individually capabilities, but we do not yet see networks or communities of artificial intelligences that share abilities. So right now each AI to like some like, ej, I can learn and learn more by themselves, but they can never learn from another AI. Exactly. They can't learn from another AI. They can't perform the function, the other AI uses because they have an easy mechanism to talk to each other. They can't form communities to solve problems you imagine. You might have an AI that's really good It means like creating colors or another one it fonts and other one that logos together that can be branded, right? For a label or for a company. So you know, these are the sorts of things right now that are teaming by individual consistency programs. And so that's why we refer this as the Internet of intelligence. It's not just data that goes back and forth. But it's not when you think one important distinction to amplify this as computers are in caveman mode, relative to where we are now. Right? So us developing this language actually allows for fruitful information to be passed back and forth where when you get inside of a model or representation, you know, Watson or other AI that you're familiar with perhaps

Unknown Speaker  7:46  
the you can't really intermix these things because there's never been a language where computers can actually say, let's hone in on a context but they finance and songwriting. There's no overlapping language to connect those models, right. They're different domains. So what do humans try to do? We try to find some sort of common ground to bridge the dialogue. And that's what we're doing here with Q is we're allowing the data to kind of facilitate back and forth. Whereas Normally, you know, they're isolated events or isolated domains that people don't intertwine. And notice you said the word you what exactly is you pay the bill is our designation for the language that the API's communicate with each other. So it has a lot of flexibility and richness of languages, but it has no structure and rigid rigidity and understandability that the AI is coming out naturally with understanding was traditionally very difficult for him. He said, like worse than learn languages, you know, like, they have a much more structured interview process, and that's where they can talk to each other. You know, where you got it. Okay, so I'm gonna see if I can kind of wrap this up in my own head here. Q is a language that AI is used to communicate with each other, and to store knowledge and data. Right, right. Great. So it's almost as if Now, let me know if there's an analogy I've kind of used in my own way to understand this. Right now, ai are kind of like dogs in that you say the word sit. And it knows that when it puts the foot down, it gets a treat. And it it does something based off of a command that you give it but it doesn't unnecessarily understand what the word sit means. Whereas this is kind of like talking to a person, almost where you say, like, I need you to sit down because guests are coming over I don't know, because because of X, Y, or Z and it could actually understand via language. What you You mean? Is that? Is that kind of? Are we on the same page? Or is that there's some similarity to that. And I think what we're talking about earlier is because you were talking about learning from each other. And you can imagine one has acquired experiences, as you were talking about me sitting down, and what does that mean? Does that mean how often visit us, and then another use of misleading word if you share those, those memories or so that history, so it has sort of awareness what that word meant. And so that's, you know, allowing them to have some ability to, you know, sort of mentally understand these disparate concepts in a shared way. I want to jump back just one second, you were talking about where's the AI now? And where do we envision it in the future? And I think a hopeful analogy, at least in my mind, is AI is now or like computers were very capable, but they're very isolated and Long time ago, there used to be special rooms, assuming only certain people can connect to them. Now, of course, they're everywhere your mobile friendly network This is, whereas our AI as far now are kind of like where those computers were then. They're very bold. They're kind of isolated. Only certain people impact the actual climate change things. And where we envision is where computers are now. They're ubiquitous. They're highly capable. They're networked everywhere. And so that's what we want to transition in. But you can't get there until they have a language and a mechanism to be able to share this information.

Unknown Speaker  11:38  
So that's really what we're talking.

Unknown Speaker  11:39  
So in that analogy, then

Unknown Speaker  11:41  
you get a

Unknown Speaker  11:44  
good quick check in guys. So like deep breath,

Unknown Speaker  11:53  
I'm feeling at around a eight or nine incomprehension. I feel like I'm understanding this really Well, and I'm focusing in on it like an eight. But I want to, I think that the next step, I think, is to take some tangible ideas and start to talk about some some real world thing for me, that's, that's what I'm trying to figure out. Like, I understand the concept, but then I'm trying to put it into a real world scenario, you know, what are the baseline? Obviously, things that I met like an eight or nine. Yeah, I, I understand the concept, I understand where it's at. But to add to see, dude, I would love to hear about real life applications, the analogy of using computers where they are now versus where they were before and showing the progression of AI as it communicates with it with other AI, I think is spot on. You know, obviously, I don't need to tell you that but keep using that as an analogy. I made a lot of sense. Yeah. And when Jared, kind of first explain to this, he was like, amazing.

Unknown Speaker  13:01  
Though sitting down,

Unknown Speaker  13:04  
much more complex and not yet,

Unknown Speaker  13:06  
like imagine sitting down with somebody and being like, hey, thanks, computer, but did you know that we can connect this to another computer? And it's like, why would we want to do that? Because it's going to change the world. And that's hard to understand like back then it's like, well, why would we need these computers to talk to other computers? Like we already are already doing what we need them to do? So yeah, I think a good segue from here really quick to kind of hone in because I think that you're going to be pointing to something that David has experienced a lot of which is, why would you ever do that? You know, and I feel like being with being with David for so long I I'm starting to pick up on the the wobble or like, he's trying to put those into practice. And so if you could explain a couple things just met, you've experienced your IoT because I think it showcases some barriers that people have like, why does this even matter? And showcase some previous technology that he's deployed, and what it's done today for Internet of Things. Yeah, how do you get to that? Cool, but not get us into that I'm staring right at a

Unknown Speaker  14:13  
slightly different question

Unknown Speaker  14:16  
for at least the direction, but to your point of cheeseparing. So that's kind of interesting, because, you know, I really wanted to kind of promote this idea. I call it the Internet of physical objects. Now, clearly, that was a mouthful, but a lot of people had a very negative response. And because this has no value by me, can we do this what value up devices or objects to the internet, I'm going to get them scanned. And, you know, it took a while for people to grasp the concept in, you know, specific examples, showing it working out, and people could sort of understand and once they understood, then they understood start doing this In the magnitude of where Internet of Things could end up, which, of course right now most people understand. But quite frankly, you know, there's Internet of Things, IoT. But internet of intelligence, I would argue, is substantially larger by many orders of magnitude. So an impact because founders what they work together I mean, that's, that's really a topic and how you can have devices not just work through this highlight, division, so. So I wanted to touch back on the internet of things because I think we're taking that a little bit for granted for the average person in understanding what the Internet of Things is. So the way I think the average person would know of the Internet of Things might be like, the idea of Alexa talking to your life, right? Alexa is a thing and your lights are a thing. So Those things communicating with each other, having Alexa turn on my lights that is functioning within the Internet of Things. Correct. So, what how else can you describe the Internet of Things? Well, okay, so that's kind of going back to this. These ideas were conceived in late 90s. But then the internet was booming. We hadn't hit it that big, you know, fall off in 2000. And so it's very exciting. People are talking about networking, everything but even you started realize what your networking, what information, but the things that you're supposed to care about, you know, food objects, your house, you know, your lawn, whatever, all those physical objects had no connection to the Internet. So that was the original fight. It's like what if we connected physical objects to the internet? What would happen then? So you can imagine if I could mix like products in grocery stores, the internet, I can just walk out the door. Everything would know where it is. So it notes in your heart, and immediately the checkout as it moves through the shelf, it would know to be missing a key or filled in automatically. So the business value was initially, the ability to connect in your house and he talked about smart home was one of the first ideas of using Internet of Things, which is your lights, heating system, your windows that can automate these things can be networked together. So, you know, it took people a while, however, to kind of wrap their heads around why Nixon has gone to the internet would actually be helpful. And I see this analogously here that we're having a hard time thinking why would you want to connect artificial intelligence together? So

Unknown Speaker  17:50  
how are you feeling?

Unknown Speaker  17:52  
I'm at about 1009

Unknown Speaker  17:55  
one good.

Unknown Speaker  17:57  
Love that okay.

Unknown Speaker  17:58  
Hopefully Is this helping you guys kind of like when we tell you where we are is that is

Unknown Speaker  18:04  
that yeah good

Unknown Speaker  18:07  
and you know when the dive deeper? Great.

Unknown Speaker  18:10  
So I really want to do I want to I want to talk about because right now we think of smart homes with IoT and I think that's a people get that they have Okay, we have smart things in our house maybe things how can I Oh, I step that up. Now let's say just specifically in the smart home world how can let's let's do some maybe some what ifs of how exactly how the internet of intelligence and step up your daily life in a smart home? Yeah, I'm gonna undertake a stab at that in but there's so many other examples. That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  18:51  
It is with a bunch of great quick advice with his own product fire.

Unknown Speaker  18:54  
Okay, so within your home, you know, you have things like that. Sometimes wherever you have devices, you have a washing machine that may break in one, two, Hey, I got a call somebody, I got it, I gotta do something about them. So you see how the Internet of Things could say, well, I'm broken. And then we communicate with something that tries to figure out what it was the best way to get the fix yourself. If you can do it yourself, can you find the parts to get somebody good for you? What's their schedule look like? All of a sudden, you realize there's a lot of complex data systems that need to be managed by Intelligent Systems make the best decisions right now we kind of do that by hand. You might say, my, it's broken. But let me let me type into Google, you know, here, and then the town you're in, and it will try to figure that out. We're talking about something good for you. Yeah, so Alright, so what if right? smoke detector, right? So right now the smoke detector runs out of batteries and just beeps at you? Right? It barks at you and says it's broken and you see fit until

Unknown Speaker  19:59  
you can't Take it, you can't take it anymore,

Unknown Speaker  20:02  
right? Where the evolution of that would be on your smartphone and pulls up a short list okay, your smoke detector is going to run out of batteries here are the three different ways to fix this here is the level of activity you have to participate in. Here's the cost like okay, you could change it yourself. If you have a battery, that's the cheapest option. That's a if you don't have any time in the world, you need somebody to come it'll call somebody and set up that time for you. That'll be it'll give you efficient solutions to be able to solve that problem based on communicating with other technologies that have gone through that process before and understood what the best scenario the best avenue for success is. And then it gives the user the human different choices with different parameters to help better and more intelligently make a decision supported by technology that is now smarter than before it doesn't just say I'm broken fix me It says I'm broken here are the the most probable solutions to be the most efficient and getting Get back up and running. Yeah, even push that further. So we're talking about Yeah, as a person, you can talk to you that understanding so, liaison to this internet intelligence. So imagine this IOI is being a large sea of AI of different abilities that are working. But then you may have one that you work with directly. Maybe it's like a manager, and it has a list of things, you can talk to it or say, hey, there's a few things you should be aware of. The smoke detector is is kind of running out of batteries. I've already ordered the battery. Or by the way, you have some downstairs for I know you don't have time to do this. I've already set up on somebody come in the house that you trust and the service that we have that we have for you. Great, and it kind of goes through the whole list. So it's not just the one but the whole litany of things even the garage door is broken again based on last time when you tried to fix it for 8.6 hours and then had to call someone we've gone ahead and just scheduled that for you for next Saturday. I know you'll do home right after the law. Only scheduled someone Different to avoid the embarrassment a little bit sarcastic

Unknown Speaker  22:02  
but effective.

Unknown Speaker  22:04  
Alright, well, what I hear when I listen to is just like to recap a little bit is something like all of us have talked about at some point is, as technology evolves and as our lives get busier, the decision fatigue is so debilitated. Having to figure out and make decisions for every single thing is exhausting. And basically, this liquid technology can just alleviate some of that, that painful decision making of every single thing in your life. Is that like, Is that pretty? Correct? Yeah, the other thing to point out is, of course, the things that we were mentioning, you know, you couldn't build something either now, but that's the point. They'll be like an isolated, senior system just to be that thing. And you can call them that. You say, Well, you know, that thing that you build doesn't work very well. And it's hard to plug in another one. A good example would be, you imagine, for the internet, you have just some fixed news source. You can't get news anywhere, there are only certain places where it comes. Now, of course, you get it everywhere, you get a better since, because there are different points of view of what's going on. Here. You know, in our vision, you would have other people that do better home management systems. And you say, well, let's do somebody else's, and it plugs in immediately to all the other intelligence. So it's not just the one out solution. You have the capability now, symptom, we can fill in the best of all worlds. And then these Shouldn't they can talk to each other, something come out and something come in and the whole system improves dramatically. If prompted with a notification to improve your life one way or another because someone somewhere in the world figured something out that intelligence, artificial intelligence was able to pick up on that. Learn that Have it and was able to share it with your artificial intelligence was able to present it to you to make more efficient what you do. And there might be ones that are, you know, even better, but something came along that some people are using. And now this thing starts to wrap on itself, right? You can have an AI whose job it is to go off and look for other AI. So an AI who recruits chaos into your system, because it's always looking around, you know, I know, you know, maybe you guys, but I read the news with the trends, you kind of figure out what's going on. But you're doing that and that's great. But imagine you haven't seen the AI is going to look at trends and say, you know, either come up with their suggestions for you or offer you for us. Yeah, go ahead and do that. So your system is self recruited.

Unknown Speaker  24:46  
I think one of the I don't go

Unknown Speaker  24:51  
to say that, you know, we're talking about smart homes and I think the smoke detector was an interesting, you know, identifiable object but I think one of the thing that really brings us throught is the fact that what happens when one thing relies on another. So let's say that you have like an electrical issue. And it's really that there's water that's leaking underneath your home. And it's causing an electrical problem. Those two things, if there's any sort of tracking system on them, or any sort of IoT infrastructure in your house, they don't communicate with each other. So if you're saying, oh, I've got an electrical shortage, and now you've got a water problem, those things can be proactive. So as soon as you've got a water leak, you say, Oh, it's connected or close to the electrical in your house, you might start having shortages in your house. And this is where simulation and things that get much more, I guess, esoteric, so we don't necessarily have to go into the craziness of it. But this is where you can start to actually expect to the point about battery and changing the battery out you can start to actually model things that are contingent upon each other, rather than just isolated events, which is really, really cool. Right? Something as simple as you know, shingles on the roof are getting too old. And you're living in an area with high amounts of rain. Before you know you're going to have issues, you're going to have problems. So being proactive and saving money long term, you know, long run, right? It's like the buy nicer buy twice, like, like, do it now, because it's going to cost you more if you wait, wait, no, you don't need to replace the roof. You saying that the roof talks to like, the electrical system underneath the roof. And when the electrical system starts to hear short, it can talk to the root system and the roof system can be like, Well, we know we're missing a tile here. That's probably the reason and then it can diagnose for you probable solutions based on the aggregate of both of those and what other roof electrical systems around the world have been able to tell it. That's, that's fascinating. That's that's one and then you know, depending on how far you push it, um, you know, you can look at sort of weather patterns. When is it actually a good time for places Are you in spring fall? There's a 43% chance you're gonna get a leak this season if you don't fix your roof. Yeah. I mean, this is where, you know, every time we're talking about that use the fact that you can build systems like this today, you can build isolated systems, you know, the Intelligent Systems over time, it takes much more time. But when you do these things, always say, hey, I need to connect to something else. I need to put this other capability in it and all of a sudden, this thing grows and grows and grows. And that's where all these funds end up. However, I have the capability just to tap into somebody else's information or knowledge system. I wouldn't need to do that I could just ask. So if that thing needed, whether it will ask me whether if you need to find find it. If it needs to actually replace something that goes to the you know, the repair yard that looks for the best bargains, and people have

Unknown Speaker  27:57  
intelligence

Unknown Speaker  27:58  
that makes the value almost exponential lives. function of activity right? Right now, the use of interconnected technology is really a product of how much you interact with it, the net effect is still requires interaction for its most effective use where there could be an exponential shift in how you change your habits based on the technology. You know, once you introduce the system, and we have more and more intelligent AI for the company, each other power the system grows exponentially instead

Unknown Speaker  28:32  
check in how are we doing?

Unknown Speaker  28:34  
Yeah, really good. Really good. I want to start talking about how how we prevented from good Sorry, I was I was about to go into this. So we just we as a recap, we were really talking about smart homes and that as a reference, but I really want to push the gas pedal now. I think we're on a good place to understand this a little bit more. Where a where does this get scary? Be? What is the Internet of automation and I guess the the Where can you see this? On a final vision like well how can this like really push us on this one? You can take it in whatever direction you

Unknown Speaker  29:09  
want. Yeah, you brought up a lot of things all at once.

Unknown Speaker  29:13  
So the scary thing first and you guys also

Unknown Speaker  29:15  
need towels that's what

Unknown Speaker  29:18  
let me give you like an example that I think of right away right? So I like fitness. I'm gonna come human that likes but I turn on my, my, my Christopher Columbus of the internet to go and seek out all the best advice and best functionality for me to take in my taking the best possible knowledge to pursue my my hobby of fitness, right. I see it getting scary when I'm inundated with so much information or I'm required to change so much or on an ongoing basis that I can't keep up with it. It becomes a detriment to my decision making process because the evolution comes so much faster than I can keep up with like I am told to eat this way before days later, somebody in Timbuktu's figured out a way to do a better net, change it then and I change it then like, how far are we, from having that technology understand where our limitations are to help us be on the efficient frontier and not be above or below it, right? That's where I get scared. But one of the problems, don't him. That's a problem. You're always getting, you know, inundated with things popping up. I mean, it's kind of funny, anytime go to anywhere on the internet, the desire for whatever site you go to, is to have some other site. I'll click on this, I don't want to click on that I'm going to do this thing. And so if you imagine, imagine having, again, I understood you or people in general knew ticular, it would be able to filter out and combine you if you can just understand I think we're going to be you know, it's like everybody is going to be add, because you're forced to do all these different things, and that's kind of the way to set up. But we could do something totally different. But you mentioned Another thing you talked about this. Next, this is where I had spent a bit of time in working in some projects in and around fitness, bone conditioning, and so on. But nutrition is a fairly rich and complex field that you will need an expert in AI that can then be used around

Unknown Speaker  31:20  
are best for you,

Unknown Speaker  31:21  
right? You need an AI just go out there and tell us whether or not we should be eating eggs or not. Right, that's like a full time AI job right there. I mean, really comes up, you know, you might go to Reddit or some subreddit, they give right? But it could filter it for you. And then often the recommendations that aren't you know, onerous in and then you can take on this and you happen to have maybe you go to a fancy place, maybe you go out with your friends, you say what's good, can you hear what we know? What's good for you, based on where you are, you're eating, eating preferences, favors you like, what's most healthy you're currently doing. And so net AI included things about restaurants. proof of work now comes about looking for new information or synthesizing it to give you the best information that you can possibly get. Interesting. So you don't see that becoming too much where it doesn't know when to stop and doesn't know when what's healthiest for the individual, right? Because I think that's where we are right now. Go ahead, there. There's nothing. There's no stopping people just making really cluttered signs with advertising. Right. But the problem is, I completely agree with you, right. And that's one of the things we've talked about a lot, right? Like, right now we're being inundated with so much that we can't process it and it's gonna into our mind, right? How do we create this pivot and with the internet and with technology and with the way that we interact with the Internet of Things, so that we can produce less chaos and less static and more sound? functional decision making right like take take the end Internet and instead of pushing us to be chaos, push us to be better at what we want to be better at. Right? I totally agree. And I think this is a powerful distinction because the internet today is just around data that goes back and forth a few years until sooner. Many people don't understand it, or you. And so with a flood of data, you're going to do, you know, tsunami of information with the thing that we're talking about turning that data into knowledge and having AI systems that can comprehend it, it can filter that you mean, you know, your preferences, so you're not inundated with the just information review on as opposed to just glancing into stuff. But the thing I think, one of the things that we talked about quite a while ago, and thinking through what were the advanced platform look like, right? So we've got browsers, we've got windows, we've got iOS and one thing that David and I got into it, I think Jared was part of this discussion is just the lack of respect that systems in general have for your sensory overload. Right? So like, let's say you're working and then all of a sudden, like flack pops up, and you've got emails coming left got thing thing everywhere. And I think that that just goes to show that systems have a lot of room to grow, to figure out how to tailor your productivity. And I think what's really interesting moving forward is when you encompass IOI with a, you know, let's just say a hardware or software that can actually figure out when you're spending type a little bit slower and figure out when you're starting to slouch and your your body language is starting to get a little bit lazy, because you're tired and you're fatigued. I think that same type of data and information can give the system insight to be able to say, Hey, man, go for a 15 minute walk. And you know, I'll take care of whatever you're researching right now. And then it goes out and by the time you get back at old cool information that you are needing to get done anyway, and you're back on your grind. I think this is a big disconnect between systems and humans that Ilan talked a lot about how you know You got to figure out how to be a cyborg. But it really there is really a symbiosis that still has yet to be really presented to us in a way that we can be accepting towards it. And it'd be fruitful for both parties. Because as you can see, right now, people are addicted to their phone, people are addicted to technology. And so it's like, we're looking we have this relationship where we're not harming ourselves. And we're not taking a ton of the time away from other people and connecting back with reality. Yeah, I mean, even kind of I'm just add to that. Right now, they're not really, they're not actually, they're flooding me with data, but they're not going to bore you are doing and it's kind of, you know, sometimes we use video game like analogies and imagine, you know, you're in a game of risotto, but you have a whole bunch of, you know, NumPy characters that are working with you and that are not idiots because really smart. Imagine that sort of thing where you have teams that are actively helping you in any way and provide a liaison between you And all the other stuff, you know, my new way. So that's kind of a positive vision. Well,

Unknown Speaker  36:07  
I got a what if

Unknown Speaker  36:10  
what if based off of the, the thread that Trevor was on about workplace and knowing when you're slouching when you're typing a little bit slower. What if you're watching TV and you are watching a movie and you start to nod off a little bit and the TV actually pauses the movie. And then your watch gives you a quick little buzz saying it's time for bed. And then you realize, wow, I am a little bit sleepy here. You start to walk upstairs with lights turn off, everything shuts down and the rain sleeps down, start to play in your bedroom. You're able to just go right to bed, after once. Once you brush your teeth actually, that toothbrush, talks to your lights that Turn off, turn down the lights to a certain level and then you go to sleep. So you can watch the movie next time,

Unknown Speaker  37:05  
like that gentle nudge to brush your teeth.

Unknown Speaker  37:08  
Gotta brush your teeth before you go and then your refrigerator locks into your being in the end you but on the other side, right now it's really, you know, unaware what you're doing? Yeah, no, you could be, for example, in a podcast, exciting, fun conversation, despite messages and people texting me stuff, just so I know that an AI would actually say, you know what, hold off on that. I don't need to close you. You don't need to see these messages. When you're done with this. Here's some things you don't need to look at all of us have pretty decent put off like, yeah, you know, again, you can build these as individual systems. But we're not talking about assembly we're talking about the infrastructure that allows these intelligent beyond the public. from Southern Greece, the environment that lets that happen. I just won one interesting bit because we were talking monolithic. I heard that come up earlier, the monolithic AI. We really want to emphasize that, you know, if we can really think about a distributed networks, similar to the way that people say distributed ledger for blockchain, or what have you, right? Have a new distributed network of AI that isn't the big monolithic, scary Terminator. That's what we really want to done before, right? They have specialized skills, and they have a network that say, Hey, can we do this? And there's a lot of the information and conversation that happens between us AI and it. I think it was a snowball effect happens in terms of media, scaring people and turning people off to the idea of AI because if you don't know the mechanics of where AI is right now, I mean, David, has been around since like the 50s 40s 50s. So AI has always been Yeah, boil up and then Expectations are way higher, we expect the world and then kind of somebody pops the balloon and says, Hey, come back to reality. It's advanced statistics that we're pushing it through a machine. And I think the ball just goes back to show that we are still leaps and bounds from the real big scary AI. Because a lot of this is mathematics. But until you bring a language to the system, there's no actually, there's no cognition, right, like people are afraid of Alexa listening to me. You know, all it is, is is running through a machine and seeing how many instances that can match to what you're trying to say and find an intent pattern or what you're trying to add. There's no actual contextual understanding of Hey, like, I need a new toothbrush, order me one on Amazon. It's just that there have been 50,000 people that have said that one mind that matches up with an order to a job when it's like telling a dog to fit. Once you train it 20,000 Times Of course, it's going to sit when you give it a treat afterwards. So it's that understanding that basis of where AI is right now. I mean, there's great advancements, but I think there's a big misunderstanding between artificial intelligence and what everybody perceives it to be an automation. And that's where we are right now is we're at that crossroad where we're trying to actually get to that level. So is that scary, though? Like, is that a fear? You know, if I understand you, it's it is the argument. It's no different than me understanding anyone and choosing to do something bad or something good, like having choice. Where does that come up in the equation is is it comprehension without choice? Is that where, what you're talking about or is it? Is it both an algorithmic aggregation of information that helps you make better choices

Unknown Speaker  40:49  
doesn't have it? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  40:50  
I think right now, it's probably more choice. I think that David, I don't know what your thought I think it's probably more choice. I think once you get into actionable decisions where there's morality involved And this is where we get into like Internet of automation, which I think we should talk about a little bit here in a bit. But I would say at this point, it's more choice. But again, these models that can run simulations on disparate data set, the question becomes like the want that bias data to affect your model. And that that the human decision, so I think that that barriers that so I want to do a real push back because I think we were circling around this, but I really want to make this as hard about language and how powerful language actually is. with humans, when we develop language, we built civilization. We're able to work with one another via communication, I'm about I'm able to say something and you're able to understand something and make actions based off of that. We are now giving language to artificial intelligence. That's a huge step there. So what what are your? What are your thoughts on how? I mean, what other things have language? I mean, it's Yeah. So there's something I was going to switch gears anyway a new distance, a good segue. So to enable what we're talking about do allow computers to network, like the internet, you needed some sort of protocol, you know, some sort of language to allow that to happen. The web needed some sort of language to present information. So HTML really allows you to visualize them. So the API's to network would necessarily need something they can understand something that we can name. So in what we're talking about earlier, is that does create a powerful change in capability from individual intelligence to arguably a huge network of AI agents that are healthy now? Here's the thing there was there was the you know, This sounds kind of scary, and maybe they're, you're controlling me and so on. But there's a flip side to this, and I think a much more positive spin on it. You know, CJ, you were talking about union to tell and nutrition, exercise and so on, you have certain aspirations, certain things that you want to do. And a lot of us do, a lot of us have visions and ideas, things you want to achieve. But to achieve them takes a lot of work. You might need expertise you don't have you might need information, you're in services that are unavailable to you. If you have this intelligent network, you can tap into some of those things that you don't necessarily have access to or capabilities and your visions and goals. So in the case of nutrition, or in wellness, you may find there's something out there that actually is fantastic. You just are unaware of it. If AI could find it for you and find it and actually find program or maybe something you're doing now then it's actually detrimental but you didn't know that they can find that for you. So as opposed Something that controlling you, you actually are more in control you are more enabled. By having network and intelligent machines and the other way around, you can achieve the goals that you're talking about make the dreams come true. So you have a vision of something you want to do. You have now you can tap into an intelligent network that can give you the capabilities that you peasy, pretty done. Otherwise, the way to look at it, I think about that friend like 15 or 20 years ago that always had that great music that no one had heard before. And you you know, they may be annoying, but you haven't stick around because they just have phenomenal music. You don't know how they can go find it. You don't know where it came from. They always have it first, right? Like you're like, Joey's a pain in the ass. But man, his music skills are ridiculous. And it's so hard to go find the best music that you keep them around. It's like you're basically creating that for anything that you intend to wake up and yeah, and of course, you know, starting companies and building your machines and automations on you run up against bots, like well, I need to work with other people. We still need to, you know, we want to patent and you know, getting patents difficult and you want to brand it and getting branded. If you guys do this to buy trademarks, you know, can I just say that, I don't know, if he had these guys that can make that easier for you, you can achieve the goals you're trying to achieve much. Or, you know, you spend a lot of time going down in directions like I couldn't, I can't go down there because somebody's already done it. But it will be helpful to know that from the get go. So these are sort of tools and capabilities that can make,

Unknown Speaker  45:33  
you know, a reality.

Unknown Speaker  45:34  
And that's how I think of it goes from like, cool to scary, right? It's scary when you're reliant upon the technology without being able to truly audit where the information came from to control what you do in your life, right. But it's not scary to have something that's believable at your side to always help you fully understand the decision that you're making so that you can make the best decision for yourself and it knows you right like I know The dog scenario right? Like the internet right now, as you tell the dog sitting at CES, imagine if the dog understood when you were thirsty, or you haven't drank water in a while it goes to the kitchen and gets you a glass of water. And it gives you a statistic about if you don't drink this water, what it could do to you and the probability you're going to get a headache, right? Like, like, that's basically, that's what it's doing. It's not telling you how to drink water, and you have to rely on it. And then it kills you because it tells you drink a glass of water in a day and you don't know any better. Right? It's giving you the power to fully understand the decision that you should make for yourself. And then it gives you the freewill to make that decision. Whatever you do as a human you do as a human, but it makes you a better

Unknown Speaker  46:37  
college accurately.

Unknown Speaker  46:40  
Yeah, yeah. It gets the truth. And then it presents you the truth. And then you make a decision based on simple pardon to find factual evidence. It promotes anecdotal evidence, right? Like, hey, here's the thing that if they can't find a definitive representation, you know, it can give the user and say, hey, look, so I've got I've got two things here. I've done as much as I can do here are the two most powerful statements on each side. Because we know other things about black and white, there's gray that, that we, as individuals and humans will always still have to make at the end of the day. So being able to represent as much human ability to still have that decision power at the end of the day is basically tried, we need that, I think that that's where we start getting away from decision making entirely. I don't know what would be come about.

Unknown Speaker  47:27  
Right, right.

Unknown Speaker  47:28  
No, no, are you there AI is to come from, you know, large entities on here. So it takes a lot of work to do what we're talking about the network of these things, ability to mock democratizes. And how a lot of people are creating these as you might have when you say no, I don't like this one at all. You know, it's kind of controlling me and I, you know, in other words, you can pick and choose the ones that are most effective for you and have those networks in the winter most effective, as opposed to coming from sources. So we're talking about like small You know, we've been Talking about a lot of examples and they are still kind of in the same realm of life size of ideas. I know David before we even started talking about like the In Home your you were like, I can give some home examples, but there's actually like far bigger examples outside of the home like I would love to hear where you're gonna go with that of how like liquid can kind of just like society as a whole thing. I think that's a good core. Next let's go to the pig, pig pig. Yeah, there's a lot I mean, you can just kind of pick and choose. I mean, there's a lot of decisions that get made at a very high level based on anecdotal evidence he sort of got here but he never or rarely hear about the unintended consequences like it can be this what might happen. These are terms of things like environment, you know, monetary policies, on just things about, you know, health we talked about a lot about you know, COVID is is Is the mask good or bad memory that there was a certain period of time that people didn't think it made no difference, but guess what it did. But if that information was vetted and understood and distributed and fast way, it could have made the difference between, you know, arguably hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide. I mean, this is a pretty big deal. Um, so, you know, the ability to have the, you know, health information, you know, weather information that you synthesize together, that can be, you know, extremely, extremely helpful that you wouldn't have thought otherwise. Let me let me give you a specific example. Early on people would be healthcare providers were treating your patients they didn't know what to do. And they were trying things and some things would work and some things are not and the way they share that information. And then other health care providers would tweet and say, Well, why don't we give that a try? What if you had an intelligent network which you access gallery, all the information from all the computers So you know what i found things that actually do work and then distribute that information to to help the providers in front months as opposed to just getting an appointment. So you can see was, you know, things like this can have a huge impact on national government

Unknown Speaker  50:18  
leaving his private company. Very

Unknown Speaker  50:28  
impressed.

Unknown Speaker  50:30  
I feel like we're getting into a, we have a really good

Unknown Speaker  50:38  
breath, breath.

Unknown Speaker  50:42  
I am feeling focus, calm, and I am at a nine out of 10 in comprehension. I'm just really excited. Like, I just want to talk about a million examples. We can use this technology in everyday life,

Unknown Speaker  51:02  
comprehension wise, I'm like, Damn, I can

Unknown Speaker  51:06  
go with an ape. Like you guys.

Unknown Speaker  51:10  
Were like when it comes to

Unknown Speaker  51:12  
wildlife, I want to know how we can help.

Unknown Speaker  51:14  
Alright guys, so

Unknown Speaker  51:17  
how have you guys implemented this technology thus far? And where are you on your journey from on a scale of one to 10? Do you think your final vision? Yeah, that's an interesting question, it might be a little bit hard to break it, because it's not necessarily a linear progression. But let me kind of give you an idea. So we started out with kind of the big picture, and trying to get people excited about that, quite frankly, is probably a little too early. People were still trying to wrap their heads around IoT. And you know, they're just looking at big data. And so, a lot I spend a lot of time looking for taking elements event technology, not the whole thing, but just parts of it and applying them in different places, applied them in governmental work. Hence, I believe healthcare, applied them in energy, nutrition and wellness, even, you know, even retail and fast food. So there's different places that elements that technology have been applied. But you can take the larger, you know, collection of those technologies to enable the vision we're talking about not just institutions, or industries. So it's kind of a transition between, say, you imagine that you have the idea for the Internet, and you show it off for nutrition now, and you say, look, we can have a website. This is not exactly this, but you can check it out. And then you show it in the show in another medicine point, you say, you know what, here's a bigger idea. I think you can share this globally. We build general systems to support it. And that's kind of it. That's where we are. So some things have been really far away. In terms of honestly women's products and applications that people are using today, and the bigger booking stuff in terms of taking it all together to the point Gen amps is only now starting. So we're taking the learnings from industries and then applying them to general Solutions.

Unknown Speaker  53:19  
Today answer,

Unknown Speaker  53:20  
you know, the idea being Do you have a good sense of where this can go? But what do you guys need to get this set up in the next?

Unknown Speaker  53:30  
The next year? Next?

Unknown Speaker  53:32  
Yeah, well look the answer in general, and maybe, Trevor, you can talk about some specific things. Well, you can kind of come together and talk about, you'd like to see this. But you know, starting any new venture and the idea is very small. So today, it It started with just me. Very, very geeky. And then two people, and then three and then four, and then it grew. In our final meetings. We've had many thousands of people Part of it in sort of impact, it took a while, of course, but its impact is somewhat global. So you start small and grow. This actually has the advantage of growing. With this concept of networking business objects, you have the complexity of actually putting something on putting that on, give me something that can lead it's, you know, positioning and identity. Whereas this is more of an informational concept. It's based on knowledge and intelligence and algorithm. There's a lot of maps into account so we can actually move potentially faster. And I think it's impactful to actually be larger. So you have a win win, in terms of the speed market. So part of it in terms of, you know, getting from a team that you have, the team you need, is getting the idea out there getting the sort of the buzz going people know what you're trying to do. And people get excited, they start to generate ideas and how can they apply that minds for you? How can I find them Ideally like, what are the things that we're going to need? And let's make those things a reality. Because that will give us some direction as well, because quite frankly, we've had about as many ideas and industries as there are industries. We found there, there's very few industries that couldn't use something like this. Whether it be healthcare, legal, government insurance, and chemistry, you know, hospital care, retail, transportation, logistics, and just kind of like rattle through them all. And then, you know, sub domains and sub domains. Nothing wouldn't be touched by the ability for computers to comprehend what you're trying to achieve. And having those things talk to each other in language that they can understand. So it comes across nearly every use. So would you say you're trying? Are you trying to grow the team? Are you looking for partnerships, so you're to have somebody when we have you come back on foot, and we were to bring somebody else along? To introduce you to and have you guys kind of riff with each other in this arena, who would be an ideal person that could that could get legs and make moves. I'm gonna have, I have some ideas. I'm never gonna have ever even thought of that as well about life. But, you know, we can see what really is the next step. And then we talked about how can we, as group get to the next year? Yeah. Well, one of the things that we've done a lot of research on and spent a lot of time as David has alluded to, he's, he's been in a very

Unknown Speaker  56:33  
bad

Unknown Speaker  56:34  
domain in different depths. And I think one thing that things are saying is that this point there's, there's a lot of core competencies that can be dragged across multiple industries. I think it's so exciting here is that what we're trying to do as a first step is really figure out what is crucial for a person to succeed or to start a business right. I think entrepreneurship is one of the most strenuous grit words Be endeavors that any person could ever take on. And so the question that we're trying to solve is like, if How could we get a platform or tool that represent the entrepreneur but also can be used as a commercial deployment product? And it's agnostic. Right? Like, what are the tool belt, you know, we think of, you know, the, the bad on Sunday going out with this tool belt, and, you know, keep the handiwork around. Now, we want to be that tool belt for everybody, right? That general purpose tool belt that people can say, hey, like, if I wanted to start an app or a songwriting app, you know, what does that look like? And a lot of what we're finding is, as we've done this, there are overlapping components that are needed across all of them. And so in the process of doing so, building a team that understands that it's actually a little bit more difficult than you'd think, because a lot of people have this mindset of one track, like, oh, we're developing this one app, right? Like you've got Uber and then you've got Yelp and you've got all these singular applications, and they're Not a lot of people who can sit back and say the general purpose of this is to create multiple paths that toolset that aren't domain specific. And that's difficult to come by, it really is difficult to get people out of the comfort zone. I would say generalists, but if people are really good at honing in their craft, but then when they come out, it's sometimes difficult to get them to crossfitters and get into a new thing. So say, just in general, is, you know, things like this are immensely helpful, because when we understand that we're communicating clearly to you all, that doesn't, that doesn't happen everyday for us, because we're, you know, we're talking to each other and we're going heads down. So obviously buzz, you know, affirmation that what we're doing makes sense to the general public. And then also, you know, what thing, you know, like Jared, the perfect instance, what is, right, like, we want to hear those things, because those are the things that drive it forward. I mean, we were talking a while back about internet of automation. And one of the biggest problems that interplanetary Automation has a problem with is that the way that communication systems lags. So once you start doing simulations on like the moon or Mars, you don't have to have people having a 15 minute communication delay back and forth and your rovers in a ditch, right, you can actually have these physical object has intelligent out in the network, they can run the contextual simulations with variables that normally would have to be communicated back and forth. So there's a lot of exciting stuff. And it's, it's always interesting to get people's perspective on that and it keeps us going. I think, as well as like, the resources are a big aspect of it, but also the wherewithal to, I can't imagine what David went through with IoT. But getting this off the ground is so important and vital to humanity moving forward in technological advances. But again, it's just so difficult to get people's mind wrapped around it clearly. And so, you know, it's really helpful to do these types of things as well. But you need you need energy towards the message, what ifs, people talking about a buzz. And surprisingly, a difficult sales plug, you need people that don't want to work on the link of the chain, but be part of the entire ecosystem for change, which sounds like a pretty darn good advertisement for a team position. And so for someone in this space, right, I feel like the opposite is abundant. A lot investors are people that are, you know, thinking about creating companies, they typically want to have to be very specific building like a Facebook or something very, and get it out there. Nothing against that. I'm just saying that, you know, it's difficult to try to develop general purpose technology, because the, you know, the drive is all these things show it to me just with this one industry. It's kind of like you're trying to build the first web browser. He said, I don't know. If I can I just have it worked in the insurance industry. It's like, No, you need other things as well. And this is kind of the same boat that we're in, you know, believe this the general purpose technology, and you can see an application everywhere. And we started to build these general claimants, both in the platform to be used as defined in languages other than the way that interacts with you, these are being built right now. And we need to get them to the next level, and then deploy globally. So that's kind of where we're at.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:35  
So at this point, is it is it people need to start a they need to understand what it is, right? That's the first step. And B, they need to start implementing it into what they're already doing. Correct. So it's like, well, like what does that look like? Like how like, if I have a business and I want to use liquid technology, what does that look like? Where, how do I do that? That's a very fair point. And that's another thing that we need to spend more time on. The two steps that will allow people to produce these API's that can connect with other people's AI is using other things in our lives. In other words, we need to go from demonstrating how the foundation plays building tools. So that that's why PPR

Unknown Speaker  1:02:27  
nets, something carbonized

Unknown Speaker  1:02:30  
so it's like, in other words, right, it's like, you're like, here's this amazing cell phone and you can talk to anybody I'm like, great. But like somebody else needs the sound. Like they have to be using it as well. Right? Like, that's how the network is building. That's how the, you know, the AI learning. So, so we just have to continue to help bring the knowledge of this and just like it's just a snowball, I'm useless. I'm stuck on a visual Help me Help Help me to, to confirm or deny that tracing. So I'm seeing like, fast forward X number of years, you're licensing a liquid product, right? I'm a small business owner. I'm starting my small business instead of hiring three or four humans to do specific jobs and hiring you to do my website and then the websites up and running and I got to figure out what to do with you and pay you as this person that does that. I can go to you and I can say I would like and I'm I'm strongly visiting like a hologram. Like I'm like, I'm going to license you it's like a butler with a British accent. Right? You know, and for my business, I have a butler with a British accent I hit the button he pops up I say I need help doing my website and it comes in it goes it goes and gets all the useful information to help me make my bestest the best decision possible as the CEO of my company. And it starts anticipate the things I'm going to need in my practice and gives me suggestions of what I should add and what I should start doing and and what I should incorporate. or start to think about. And then if I go, you know, I really want to pivot from hula hoops to, you know, how do I import and export ice cream, you have not signed up for that package yet. If you'd like to learn about international exports, please download this add on. And then you can get the add on and then it'll start reaching out to international experts to help you grow your business but you, you buy basically a model of certain packages that you want it to be able to do. And then you can do add ons over time and and incorporate new things to be able to evolve with your business. But it's it's basically a SAS, but it's like more than a SAS because it's a smart SAS if you will it. It is a ever evolving employee that can do whatever you need to do and sequential sequentially or move back or learn and grow with you. Am I am I off base there? Yeah, I was thinking about, you know, as we're going through that scenario, it might be that way. It might work that way, but it might also be that there's no number of people who produce websites and sort of artificial intelligence, he did a good job putting a site together based on what your company is trying to do. And you know, having interviewed, let me understand. And then that would recruit a whole bunch of other AI, things like images, graphics are really good at layouts, and actually generate the thing before you that you can get to that goal much, much, much faster. You know, other things that we've talked about meeting ideas, meeting trademarks, for certain products, you need someone who can get that past. accountancy sees another example has been happening for somebody else. Or conversely, is there a patent or capability that I could use that are already out there that have sort of an intellectual property that you can attack other things which would be a great idea is that really something you should be doing first place lets you know, this, that idea and sort of opinions on So you have these guys that are doing an email at the interface, you know, this is a great idea, I think you can do it. And now you got to build a team. So you can have a recruiting AI that actually goes out of eligibility and immediately start building a team. And of course, when you're talking about vision further down the line, that team would include other agents that involve specialized capabilities that you can work with as, as a hybrid human being to actually instantiate the vision that you have an exhibition, I think, to be to be clear on this because I think I hear where you're coming CJ, like, the product side of it is, is kind of like saying, How do you productize the web. And so in this instance, like IOI, it's a little different to prioritize, prioritize, kind of like we're saying, oh, we're going to build like a wick for IOI right? We're gonna build a toolset that people can interact and build things on this internet of intelligence, whereas with the web, you know, like, there was a lot of, there's a lot of muscle and manpower that went into actually building the web and connecting computers to web paper. So we're in that phase of getting people to understand what IoT is, so that these things can actually be enabled.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:21  
Right? So instead of changing the habits in the way people go out, we just, I still go to a website to gather information, but instead of going to a website, it's a it's a aggregated group of API's that have communicated with each other to create exponentially better content when I go there. And I reach out to that AI to grab my information instead of having a sidekick that goes and does that for me and learns my preferences and, and proactively goes and does that research for? Yeah, maybe in the future future, but I completely agree with you and that's, in my opinion, very sound Do you know, adapt patient is crucially important. Everything technology, so I'm going to use it It ain't gonna work.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:04  
So for you guys expanding their team, and you know,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:08  
I mean, I we can help.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:09  
Yeah, like how like, that's the whole point of upsell, upgrade Insightly, like, we're here not only to like, understand what you're doing, but also like, how can we use our resources? How can our listeners that are out there help in real time and like, this is a this is a place in a community that real people can help build ideas. So like, is it funding? Is it just, you know, expanding a team of people who are willing to work on this? in certain ways, like, specific out anything specific actually just help? That's a great question to me. So almost all Yes, to all the above. So, people that have certain skills, so obviously we do money programming. So, you know, having researches backwards, looking at applications, there's a lot of things you haven't thought of The whole purpose here is going to communicate these ideas. And just when they originally came out, not everybody knew everything that was going to be on it. It kind of grew in volume. So I didn't, I wanted that to some of your new ideas and applications. You know, obviously, yeah, it's funny, because in some of this stuff, you know, requires me to have a team that actually builds and develops before and disseminates his ideas as well. So that would be important. You know, the other thing we didn't mention as much on in my book is some good and support, are there things that are scary? And if there are any, we make sure that we put systems in place and how people think about duplication, so those don't happen. And then conversely, well, if you build such a system, how can that make me or make us much, much better? And maybe ideas about how we can actually have those beneficial instead was detrimental. You know, I think when the internet first started, we didn't think you're going to see pop ups all the places and things gonna get in the way But that didn't happen. And then of course, was ways to help mitigate that we want to nip that in the bud. Think about ways of careful deployment of this type of technology not get into the Bennett situation. So all of those, I think would be important. Yeah, they even roundtable ethics. I mean, that's, that's a huge thing. Because once you start really understanding the level of advancement that we're going into, there are going to be things where it's like, how much do humans make in the decision making process with it, like, I'm gonna buy it is, is there a push to these AI that then sold trades back into the system? So I think that's the big point that to David's point, you know, people when they were building the web weren't thinking about malicious spam attacks, right and, and stealing people's money out of a wiring account, but there's always going to be that malicious activity that we're going to have to be aware of, and I think that proactively thinking about what's coming next On the flip side, you know, the negative side of things, and being aware of those things is is unique because we have so I have not done that with technology. So, but I am excited because as we've talked about the evolution of technology there, there are gonna be so many interesting new domains that pop up. And we'll have to also, you know, caution those things as they come up as well.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:14  
And one other, I'm going to

Unknown Speaker  1:11:15  
add to you, which you guys can be heard every year, is what it means.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:22  
So, you know, we, you know, have this idea

Unknown Speaker  1:11:25  
and you're trying to communicate it,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:27  
and we may not be

Unknown Speaker  1:11:29  
13 that resonate, and people come. And, you know, Trevor had the tagline of trying to do artificial intelligence, what the internet did for computers, and I think that's really helpful. So there may be other things like that. And then as we go forward into our examples, if people resonate with things that they're worried about, that we can actually work, as you know, other things, you know, the ideas of, you know, taking your dreams and creating the future, easier.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:58  
These are all things that you need. Perfect.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:03  
For those of you in we're listening in the quote unquote sense making space or game be. You're familiar with these things. We need your help. This is I think this is something that is extremely important to be thinking about you guys have had a lot of rigorous thought in this space right now. And how can that world utilize this technology to make to upgrade societies? That's, that's really my question. My challenge to you scoring. Yeah, I mean, it was a perfect segue, right, like Yeah, one of the things that's most important to you is the clarity of your message and that's the first of the three scores right? And so, let me break it down for like five seconds. So the reason why we do these scores is because we want to have you come back and we want to be able to give you feedback on significant improvement or areas of decline or increase on the different sides of things. So the the reason why we talk about clarity is because In my opinion, and in all of our opinion, your delivery of the message to be able to round up excitement is crucial, right? If nobody listens to could be the best idea in the world. So understanding clarity and how and, and charging you with coming back next time and improving that clarity score is really important because now we're all on the same page and trying to get you there and trying to focus on that patch in the same way. I think of heavy action as as believability. Like you've not just talked about it, you've done and I think about light activity as Oh my God, if somebody is looking for something to really make a change in and get involved in something that's in like the third any would be phenomenal, because there's a lot of room to grow. There's a lot of action that can come. And then the potential is obvious, like How exciting is this? Right? I want to I want to know that the level of potential is either there or growing each time that we talk because you've gone into that environment. You've been able to seek those opinions, that feedback to grow the potential of what you're trying to get. Are you recap grated after working on it longer, like, you know how many I mean, just being a songwriter, it's like my first idea is rarely the one that that's a final, right. And if every, every time I put a song out, I was just giving them the first idea. I'd be really disappointed after a while. So, yeah, so I'm a numbers guy. And I really loved the idea of this. And I love the positive reinforcement of this and the focus that it creates, because at the end of the day, like, the differentiation point that again, we hope to create here is that we're about doing what about action through providing you a platform to be able to show your true self. Right. So

Unknown Speaker  1:14:42  
let's do that with this course. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:45  
Clarity score. 30 score. All right. I know what I want.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:49  
We need to perk up for the

Unknown Speaker  1:14:52  
get graded.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:55  
usually sit around I do.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:58  
Alright, here we go. Can you see It Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00  
our score is

Unknown Speaker  1:15:02  
7397 for clarity, three for action and nine for potential. Wow, it's gonna be tough to beat nine. I don't get tense pretty much ever and it's gonna be a long time before it's more because we omit the cap on a three Yeah, I think for me the score doesn't go higher than nine. So you got you got my you got my full I'm fully on board on this one. So it's clear it could get better and clarity right obviously which is we've all noticed that and it's a moving target anyways as this thing moves. The action plan is right for activity right for people to come on board and start getting involved right now. Right you're not getting in locked into an organization that's not going to care about your opinion. You know, and you're looking for people with a voice right with a goal. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:53  
that's what we want.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:54  
Yeah. I know something really specific that I should have mentioned or eliminated racist. For a little bit of sort of year term, MC, yeah, I mentioned it and get people excited to think about it pretty soon on this, but I'll just throw it out there. One of the things that can help with previously is to have, I think conferences, you can have a little bit, a lot of recognition, but some sort of a forum where we get a larger number of people that could suit certain aspects. And I floated this idea around so maybe somebody can help protect this. We're in Europe having to use it. And the legal somebody doesn't seem to finance the unfortunate demon, like little snippets. So the action would be put a date on the calendar to create the first IOI conference. Arguably small, maybe a dozen, maybe two dozen you can sort of use online forum to then get little vignettes for a little presentation but what else that getting gets the whole group excited. So that is very solid to do. That's a great idea what if workshop while I think What a workshop.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:01  
Yeah, what in we could do

Unknown Speaker  1:17:02  
we could do an upset zoom. Oh, yeah. And have people you know, join that

Unknown Speaker  1:17:10  
maybe want to add

Unknown Speaker  1:17:14  
all of this we can do quick fire

Unknown Speaker  1:17:15  
across like 20 people. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:18  
yeah. Get about you know 1424 you know that kind of like range? Yeah. If you're listening head to upset CO and we're going to have all the info there. Up so.co you'll find all the info or the the what if workshop or what if workshop Hey, internet of intelligence whose source you

Unknown Speaker  1:17:40  
love that hand

Unknown Speaker  1:17:40  
branding. Hi Jim glad

Unknown Speaker  1:17:42  
we got an off the plane guys. Yeah, love that. All right

Unknown Speaker  1:17:45  
739 going in the book. We'll put that up on the site with all of the content for for what y'all are doing over at liquid. This is this is great. Yeah, I'm excited about

Unknown Speaker  1:17:54  
thank you so much for talking us through this and

Unknown Speaker  1:17:58  
any recap salutations For the audience that you want to plug your website where you guys where you guys located.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:10  
I get upset with mine. And I think lunch,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:14  
actually very excited.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:16  
Thanks so much. Yeah. Thank you
